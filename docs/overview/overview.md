# Industry Toolkit

## Overview

The Industry Toolkit is a collection of assets that enable system development in Industry 4.0.

Assets include architectures, use cases, Ansible playbooks, Tekton resources and guides in the Industry 4.0 space created by the IBM Build Labs team. The assets in this toolkit can be used as tools to learn or to help with the provisioning, configuration and installation of various software resources and systems, inspired by the work we did with IBM clients in Industry 4.0.

## Use Cases

* **Edge Data Gateway** - devices on the edge can be small appliances that function as a data gateway. A edge data gatewaty may run on a single node device as small as 2 cores with 4Gb RAM (2x4). To still profit from container and container orchestration like Kubernetes, you need an optimized edition of Kubernetes or OpenShift that can run on a single node cluster, like [single node OpenShift (SNO)](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/meet-single-node-openshift-our-smallest-openshift-footprint-edge-architectures) or [MicroShift](https://microshift.io).

## Guides

* **ODI DevOps Pipeline** - The ODI DevOps Pipeline uses a collection of Tekton tasks intended for DevOps admins looking to setup and run an automated install of ODI onto OpenShift clusters. IBM Open Data for Industries (ODI) runs on Red Hat OpenShift and is built on the Open Subsurface Data Universe (OSDU) data foundation for the oil, gas and energy industry. ODI integrates fully with an IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) and can expedite data handling across on-prem, public cloud, multicloud or at the edge.
